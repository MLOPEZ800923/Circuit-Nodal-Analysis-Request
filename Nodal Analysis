Circuit Nodal Analysis Request
Analysis Requirements
Perform a complete nodal analysis on the following netlist-defined circuit. The analysis should include:

1. Circuit Description
Identify the number of essential nodes (excluding the reference node)

Generate an ASCII art representation of the circuit

Label all nodes with their reference designations

2. Nodal Analysis Preparation
Select the reference node (typically ground)

Assign node voltages (e.g., V₁, V₂) to remaining essential nodes

Determine if any nodes are constrained by voltage sources (with brief justification)

3. Nodal Equations
Apply KCL at each non-reference node

For voltage sources:

Apply supernode technique if needed

Include constraint equations

Present equations in matrix form: [G][V] = [I]

Include intermediate calculations for conductance terms

4. Solution Requirements
Solve the system for node voltages (using Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion)

Calculate actual branch voltages and currents from node voltages

Highlight final values in bold

5. Verification
Verify results using Kirchhoff's laws:

Current law at nodes

Voltage law around loops

Perform power balance check
